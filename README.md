### tds_session_clustering.ipynb

__Overview__
In this analysis, we segment the visits to an e-commerce store based on the visitors' behavior. The goal is to understand types of trips users take to the store. We use k-means clustering to achieve this.

__Data__
We used a year of data taken from the Google Merchandise Store. Google made this data available as part of their Google Analytics demo account. User IDs and PII data have been removed from the dataset, which limits the user-level insights we can generate from this dataset.
